Here are some of the projects you can explore in my portfolio:

Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of placing three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win. The game is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, showcasing basic front-end web development skills.
